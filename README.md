# The Devil and the Coin Flip Game
https://editor.p5js.org/infwaald/present/0VykBeZ7A

## The puzzle
  >You're playing a game with the Devil, with your soul at stake. You're sitting at a circular table which has 4 coins, arranged in a diamond, at the 12, 3, 6, and 9 o'clock positions. You are blindfolded, and can never see the coins or the table.
 
 >Your goal is to get all 4 coins showing heads, by telling the devil the position(s) of some coins to flip. We call this a "move" on your part. The Devil must faithfully perform the requested flips, but may first sneakily rotate the table any number of quarter-turns, so that the coins are in different positions. You keep making moves, and the Devil keeps rotating and flipping, until all 4 coins show heads.
 
 >Example: You tell the Devil to flip the 12 o'clock and 6 o'clock positions. The devil might rotate the table a quarter turn clockwiae, and then flip the coins that have moved into the 12 o'clock and 6 o'clock positions (which were formerly at 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock). Or the Devil could have made any other rotation before flipping.

>What is a shortest sequence of moves that is guaranteed to win, no matter what the initial state of the coins, and no matter what rotations the Devil applies?

My assignment required all tails to be up

## How to use
- *New random setup* - randomizes coins, starts a new game
- *Next turn* - self explanatory, includes the Devil's move
- *Manual moves (on/off)* - test all possible moves. Player's moves are disabled if the Devil hasn't turned the table yet
- *Hide coins (yes/no)* - "blindfolded" mode. If you wanna play yourself :)
Your goal is to get all tails (ðŸ¦…)
